Playground to mess around with python, electron, containerized.

To get results that are written to stdout/stderr, you need to use `docker logs [image name]`

docker exec to run stuff inside container.

Need to set up docker compatibility with WSL 1.

Need to forward an X server port and install an x client on the host to use x
programs.
